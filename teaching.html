										<h2>Introduction</h2>
									</header>
		
									<div class="content">
										<p>I have served as a teacher in diverse learning settings; I’ve provided 
										tuition to primary school children, assisted
										adults in language learning (English, German, Portuguese and Spanish) and also
										taught to university students subjects that are related to my own subject matter,
										that of linguistics. As I’ve strived to adjust and respond to a variety of
										learning needs and also out of my own lifelong experience as a learner, some
										personal teaching and learning strategies have unavoidably surfaced. These
										principles have, of course, also been shaped by the current pedagogical climate
										and my personal research and reading of relevant material. One can hardly claim
										to “invent the wheel”, when there is so much accumulated experience in the form
										of specialized literature on teaching methodologies, seminars, university web
										pages etc. One can perhaps hope to add a tiny spoke to the wheel: tales of
										successes, mishaps and struggles on the way to becoming a better teacher and
										learner.</p>

										<h2>Core principles</h2>
									</header>

									<div class="content">
										<p>As Brookfield notes, one of the key factors
										in determining how successful a teaching experience is going to be is
										determined by the learners’ view of the teacher, and more specifically if the
										educator is seen as authentic and credible. Authenticity in this context is
										defined as the ability to be viewed as honest and open, having open channels of
										communication, inspiring an atmosphere of trust and thus laying the groundwork
										for successful collaborations and group work (Brookfield, 2006). Credibility
										concerns the teacher’s ability to appear in command of her material, confident
										and––perhaps most importantly––as the possessor of knowledge that is pertinent
										to the students’ needs (Brookfield, 2006).</p>

										<p>Having been nurtured as a learner in an academic environment that purports to be
										libertarian and prioritizes the educational and emotional needs of the learner,
										it wasn’t difficult for me to make the transition as a teacher and keep the
										same values. I discovered in the process that private lessons do differ from
										group lessons in at least one major respect; it is much easier and quicker to
										establish good relations in a one-on-one lesson. In a group lesson, group
										dynamics can be complex and it is essential to establish at an early stage who,
										among the students, are more amenable to you, who are more resistant and who
										appear to be passive and indifferent. After many hours of teaching in classes,
										I can only conclude that it is not always feasible to convert all of the
										students to attentive and enthusiastic learners. It is important, however, to
										maintain from the very first lesson that you are open to discussions,
										suggestions and that you are prepared to be flexible and allow students to
										affect (up to a point) the content and mode of instruction. Reiteration of these principles at regular intervals and especially showing
										in action that you are responsive to the learners’ needs and feelings is almost
										certain to produce results and foster feelings of trust and positivity in the
										classroom. </p>

										<p>Establishing credibility is largely a matter of personal effort and preparation. Mastering
										your own subject matter is the first and most important step. I can state with
										a certain degree of assurance that my lengthy fieldwork experience for my PhD
										(one and a half years in the jungle), forced me to come to terms with many
										theoretical principles in phonetics, phonology, morphology and syntax; through
										reading, trial-and-error, and under the tutelage of some very respected
										linguists in their respective fields, I managed to record and analyze a Panoan
										language that is amongst the most underdocumented languages in the Amazonian
										region. Of course, knowing what you want to teach does not guarantee that you
										are going to teach it successfully.  Adapting to the norms and rules of
										the institute which hosts you, necessarily introduces some considerations as to
										what you are going to teach and at what level. Also, I try to be always
										aware––and that is a lesson from pragmatics and discourse analysis––that as a
										teacher one unavoidably engages in politics on a classroom level. A part of it,
										which has already been mentioned, consists of recognizing classroom dynamics.
										Knowing how to orchestrate the efforts of a large group of people necessitates
										the use of some basic leadership qualities: knowing when to instruct and when
										to listen, when to intervene, and how to isolate potential disruptive
										activities. These are tools of the trade that are acquired while teaching.
										Displaying confidence, but not arrogance and never assuming or implying that
										you know all the answers is always a good starting point for me in any of my
										classes. There are also certain techniques, which will be analyzed in a more
										practical section further down.</p>

										<p>My philosophy of teaching goes hand in hand with how I visualize the ideal learner
										and I will borrow a theoretical term from Hopkin’s guide, that of powerful
										learning which involves the ability of students to work on tasks singly and in
										groups, respond to tasks effectively, acquire new skills and the ability to
										reflect on success and failure (Hopkins, 2014). This leads, according to Hopkins,
										to metacognition, the ability to self-reflect as a learner and take control of
										the learning process (Hopkins, 2014). My intention each time I enter a new
										class is to encourage students to wean off the traditional stereotype of
										the dominant teacher and introduce the concept of the teacher as
										collaborator/mediator. In modern university settings this is, of course,
										facilitated by student presentations and group discussions and I try to take it
										a step further by instructing students how to evaluate each other’s work and
										comment in class. My aim is to intervene only when an impasse has been reached
										and to steer the conversation/work to the right direction. I believe that in
										this way the students invest more in learning and become more autonomous. That
										said, I am not in favor of eradicating teacher instruction completely. There
										needs to be some sort of input from the teacher as well, and it goes without
										saying that there are some institutional guidelines that also affect the mode
										of instruction and should be taken into account by the teaching staff.</p>

										<h2>Practical application</h2>
									</header>

									<div class="content">
										<p>This section is the direct output of the
										principles mentioned above. We should bear in mind, though, that each class is
										unique and the instructor needs to respond appropriately and employ different
										activities and modes of teaching. Therefore, the descriptions that follow are
										not meant to portray an exhaustive or in-depth list of my preferred techniques
										of teaching, but they are rather indicators of how I actually work as a
										teacher.</p>

										<p>The first hours of teaching in a new class can be effectively summed up as a
										reconnaissance mission; the aim is to create “a positive learning environment
										[that] involves classroom routines, the way a teacher relates to the class,
										activities to discover how students feel about the class, and more” (Hopkins,
										2014).  It is imperative, in my view, to be from the very beginning clear
										and concise about what the course is about and what you expect from the
										students: clarity and a concise plan prevents misunderstandings and helps
										students decide whether the subject matter will aid them in their studies. A
										well-written handout or a short PowerPoint presentation can convey the message
										effectively. The introductory part to the lecture should also ideally give a
										foretaste of how the classroom is supposed to work, what the classroom routines
										will be like and will determine the degree of student intervention and
										autonomy, which as I’ve mentioned before, should be cultivated whenever
										possible. An instructor should also use warm-up activities in a seminar-type
										setting to learn the students’ names as soon as possible, in order to create a
										positive atmosphere. It should be noted, though, that in a lecture hall with
										dozens of participants this may not be practical.</p>

										<p>Prior to each lesson––or at least at regular intervals––it is nowadays almost
										standard practice to provide notes to the students on the main points of the
										course and upload them to a university platform. Care should be taken not to
										reduplicate the actual teaching experience or render the actual notes
										excessively lengthy and detailed, as this may discourage class participation
										and attendance (Brookfield, 2006). The design of classroom activities should
										also take into account that research has stipulated a learner attention span of
										at most twelve minutes for each teaching activity (Brookfield, 2006), so there
										should be some bridging activities that pave the way for a different activity
										every ten to fifteen minutes.</p>

										<p>It is difficult to analyze in greater detail classroom activities and procedures
										without having recourse to a concrete course design, but a few words should be
										dedicated in parting to course evaluation activities. It is, of course,
										mandatory in most universities for a professor to provide feedback
										questionnaires to her students, but that rarely happens more than once per
										course. What I have in mind is a more personalized and informal tool that can
										be used far more regularly and aid the teacher in critical self-reflection, so
										that she can either receive a positive affirmation or decide to change
										routines, activities and behaviors that do not seem to be functioning.
										Brookfield uses the term ‘Critical Incident Questionnaire’ (CIQ) to describe a
										short questionnaire of his own devising that provides space for students to briefly
										comment on learning experiences or teaching incidents once a week (Brookfield,
										2006). I am not necessarily advocating the use of this particular
										questionnaire, but I am generally very much in favor of regular feedback from
										students. </p>

										<h2>Conclusion</h2>
									</header>

									<div class="content">
										<p>I would like to end my teaching philosophy
										statement on a more personal note, as I believe that teaching theories­––though
										of undeniable value––can seem rather impersonal and detached and do not address
										the individual motives each teacher has both at the beginning of her career
										path and later on: these motives that form the cornerstone values of a teacher
										and provide the necessary momentum for working in often adverse and demanding
										conditions. Teaching for me is a way to reach out, to connect, to inspire and be
										inspired...Teaching is action and reaction, a journey and an adventure that I
										strive to share with my fellow passengers, the students. It can be tiring and
										challenging, but it is never boring and it can be at times magical, as it
										unfailingly dishes out liberal doses of the unforeseen each time you set foot
										in a classroom. But apart from that, it affords a sense of belonging to a
										social order that is much wider and higher in magnitude than the usual circle
										of acquaintances, friends and family and an awe-inspiring ability to affect
										changes that will hopefully make this world more tolerant and enlightened.</p>
